# Correlation-Analysis
Association rules with low support thresholds and mining for long patterns can be uninteresting or misleading. Support and confidence measures are insufficient at filtering out uninteresting association rules. To tackle this weakness, support and confidence framework can be supplemented with additional interestingness measures based on statistical significance and correlation analysis or association attributes. Objective interestingness measures, based on the statistics can be used as one step toward the goal of weeding out uninteresting rules [1]. Important property null-(transaction) invariance, for measuring associations among events in large data sets, but many measures do not have this property [2]. In this study, we examine a set of null-invariant and not null-invariant interestingness measures and proposed new null-invariant interestingness measure.
